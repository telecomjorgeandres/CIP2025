Write a Fill in the Blank program (similar to the one in the Print Input Lesson). Your program should request three strings from the user:

1. a color

2. an adjective

3. a goal you would like to achieve 

The story should then fill in the template:

At dawn the sky turned [color], and the air felt [adjective]. I decided today I will finally [goal].

Here is an example run of the program:

A color: blue   
An adjective: smelly  
A goal you would like to achieve: eat fewer bugs  
At dawn the sky turned blue, and the air felt smelly. I decided today I will finally eat fewer bugs.

Here is another example run of the program:

A color: pink    
An adjective: friendly   
A goal you would like to achieve: learn to code   
At dawn the sky turned pink, and the air felt friendly. I decided today I will finally learn to code.

Note that the autograder is really particular about formatting. Your input prompts must be exactly:

"A color: "
"An adjective: "
"A goal you would like to achieve: "
