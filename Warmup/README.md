Your task: Write a program in the editor, that makes Karel move, pick a beeper, then move.



If you are feeling stuck ask a question on the discussion forum:

The "editor" is the area to the right with the tab heading "main.py" where you can write text. You should write a solution as a Karel program.



Your program should have a main function with three commands:





move()



pick_beeper()



move()

When you hit the run button, your program will execute line-by-line. After it finishes, Karel's world should look like this:

#Look at Warmup picture



Confused? No worries. This problem uses material from chapters 1 through 4 in the Karel Reader. Have you read that yet?
